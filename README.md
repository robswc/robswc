### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Robert S.W. Carroll (robswc)

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer based in Virginia. I'm currently working on creating resources for quantitative trading and developing python-based applications at both Shenandoah Research and ![Synctivate](https://github.com/Synctivate). I enjoy all things computer science and hope to eventually push the boundaries within the field. See more about me.
